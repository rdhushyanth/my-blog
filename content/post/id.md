Well long time no see.....I made up my mind to elaborate today about some of the IDEs that I have had a chance to work with. Listed in order worst first(my limited-and truly biased view) are:

1. dreamweaver: I think it's no longer called by that name since adobe brought over macromedia but anyway itwas the the first web developer friendly IDE i worked with hence I decided it needs a passing mention. It has some all the common niceties like code-completion,.... but since I am highly against proprietary tools I'll let this one pass.

2. Eclipse-An idea that can change the world...Eclipse is the least(least??) common denominator first conceived by IBM. Sort of a base IDE which you can top off with plugins of your choice. Completely open source(yipee!). If there is something nice you are looking for...some feature , some idea, anything  chances are there exists a plugin for it already. The latest ganymede of eclipse is causing problems for me as of now hence I have given it the second last position(if someone is listening out here- when I added a c/c++ development plugin on top of a php development tools all in one eclipse, I lost out all the php functionality-code highlight, even the php perspective-anyway maybe it is due to a problem on my side)

3. Well here is my star player- Aptana studio(based on eclipse and also available as an eclipse plugin)- I fell in love with this piece of beauty the instant I installed it. It has got it's own internal server(never used it though) but what's more important is that it can use an external server too- that means all I have to do is fire up wamp...add the location of httpd.exe in a "add new external server" and I can preview my page right out of aptana itself...no need to open up a browser. I can view my page rendered for firefox, IE(and others if I wish to) in a nice tab alongside the source of the page. What more can a newbie like me wish for!

So the winner right now in my limited experience is Aptana..
