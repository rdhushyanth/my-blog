It has been a long time since I had time to post something. While days have gone by, I haven't been idling. The reason I have no time is because I have become too engrossed in my appengine work.  Appengine, did i mention that before? ah shucks no it seems....time sure flys by.

So as usual the links(in this case link):

1. [http://code.google.com/appengine/docs/](http://code.google.com/appengine/docs/) The official and possibly only documentation out there...

So appengine is google's answer to amazon's EC2 cloud computing. Switching to appengine won't be easy, especially if you are very much into SQL databases. The shift to appengine can leave you gasping for air(or for JOIN :D). Anyway since I was new to this whole stuff-web development, SQL, etc- so I found nothing much difficult. I think I have already professed my love for python. The whole pupose of studying python then was to gear up for appengine. Python is a language that lets you do your work and doesn't get in your way.

But java developers need not be afraid. It is cuurently available in Java(with a very nice eclipse plugin) and  Python flavour. Choose whatever tastes best to you :)

I started by doing the "getting started" thing, thereafter it was plain sailing. Not that plain a sailing though. Thing is the tutorial they give is based on webapp( a web application framework based on python- something like struts, rails, etc). Webapp is new in this brutal world of internet, hence its evangelists are few if not none. What I did was switch to django. Django??? what's that? haven't I told about that before...Shucks I must be losing sense of time and space. Either way django is too good to be made just a passing reference, I'll elaborate about it in the next post or something. Promise .

So what was I doing in appengine. well a nice application called "sanjhachoolha" ([http://code.google.com/p/sanjhachoolha](http://code.google.com/p/sanjhachoolha)). Since this is the reason for my sustained absence in the blogosphere, I'll harp about it later in a different post.

Either way what is so great about appengine- well its free hosting- atleast that's the most alluring aspect for me. Also scalability, a techno-crap word. It is to say it will "deliver" for a large crowd without you needing to bother about servers, their maintenance, etc. And did I mention BDFL- Guido van rossum is a google employee currently working on appengine? So scalability, free hosting  vs a "different" approach to databases. Most of the databases you have heard about are "relational" but google's "datastore" the database of appengine in "non-relational" in nature. What I can say is appengine dtabase is like an infinite excel sheet. you can add anything almost anywhere, they need not be under the same column, the same column may have different types of entries, etc. Cloud computing is something which will probably drive the future, so having a basic understanding of what it can do and what are the possible limitations it will suffer, these are very essential for a prospective software enthusiast.

So my TODO list is: a post on django and a post on "sanjhachoolha"

Also audience- Post some comments please, (someone, something, anything...)my blog looks empty :'(
