title: Cry, The beloved country- by Alan Paton
date: 2009-07-29
---

The book is divided into 3 sections. Roughly they describe:

1. The sufferings of pastor Kumalo- a black priest.

2. The sufferings of Jarvis-a white farmer, and of South Africa.

3. The way ahead for all.

The author Alan Paton is a white, who used to be a jailor in _____. I didn't expect it to be an anti-apartheid book, nor was it Paton's desire to have it as such I guess. This book is more about the roots, the culture, the tribe. It is about the 'beloved country' so to speak. The author doesn't wish us to feel angry towards the white or the black. The book is(or rather was) about South Africa 'as is'. Paton doesn't tell us clearly who is responsible for the apartheid related problems in South Africa- whether it is the mistake of the whites who dismantled the tribal system(tribal chief, advisors, etc) prevalent in SA without offering the blacks an alternate system to fallback upon , or the blacks themselves who didn't / couldn't adapt to the changes and found the wrong way in the process. In fact Paton refrains from presenting a one-sided view and tries to cover neutral ground. The way he handles it is 'These are the problems facing us South Africans. Lets deal with it.'

So this book is a gentle read. Take your time thinking , pondering, 'feeling' the beloved country.

Here I end my first true post. I'll see if I can write down the story in a nutshell in the next post.
