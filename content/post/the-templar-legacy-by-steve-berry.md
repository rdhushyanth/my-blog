I got my first batch of 20 users for my first review of Cry, The Beloved Country 2 days before but that has dwindled to just 2 users yesterday. So to prop up the figures I have decided to post my next review a tad earlier.

This is the first time I came across Steve Berry. The novel under consideration is about the all too common topic - the templars(the title conveys as much I guess ;) ). The comments at the back cover suggested readers will feel a sense of deja vu after readinng The DaVinci Code (DVC). I must disagree though -the novel is nothing like DVC - and that is a compliment. The book begins in Denmark at Copenhagen, which is quite refreshing considering the fact that most of the books(which I have read) are set in Britain or America.Copenhagen does offer us a new unheard of backdrop.

The pace of the book is not very fast like in DVC( should I compare??) but neither is it a snail's pace. I'd have liked it much better if the pace had been a bit quicker. The story has few suspenses to offer and has only few "core" points which the author stretches into a book. Thre are no revelations after revelations- just one not so grand idea at the end.

All in all the book is definitely million times better than Umberto Eco's Foucault's Pendulum. If not for the matter, then atleast for the backdrop and imagination.
