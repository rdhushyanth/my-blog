Well long time no see. It has been two weeks since I posted something. Today, it will be a general chitter-chatter

First things first: fedora 11 is out. Checkout[ http://fedoraproject.org/get-fedora ](http://fedoraproject.org/get-fedora). I'll point out beforehand before anyone curses me afterwards- there are a few quirks in the installation. In my case I'll be waiting for fedora unity([http://fedoraunity.org](http://fedoraunity.org)) to come up with its spin before jumping right in. But seriously guys, it's me, you, our fault that these minor glitches came up. If only I (you/we) had taken a few minutes to beta test the product, it would have been better for all of us. Testing is not that difficult- mostly its a matter of spending 1 hr(oh my gosh!.. I can't afford to loose that time- hell with that cliche) in one month/ week and filing bug reports.
I for one will try my best to put up that time(my hardware permitting) for the next release.

For those still following my intern- well my appengine project hit a pause, as I am supposed to resolve some minor bugs in a symfony project which my mentor has completed. Since I dashed out into symfony without my PHP basics, I decided it was time to learn symfony in detail and hence decided to start at the source- PHP. So I have started learning php from the apress book "beginning php and mysql". I find it very detailed( perhaps too much? )and also starting from the scratch( that means newcomers to computer languages- if such a specimen of adult homo sapien of the subspecies "geek" still exists- will find it most friendly).
Now PHP is a quite strange language. I must admit as of now I am highly biased against it in favour of python(python rox \o/). But since many things in internet is either php or asp( atleast my friend said so), I decided to learn php in earnest, good or bad.
If you have a c, c++ background you'll find it doesn't have anything extraordinarily different( at least on the surface, which is how deep I have been into PHP)- except some "loose typing" features. I believe if php comes in with something like IDLE( the python IDE) or IRB( interactive ruby) it might increase its fan following a little more.

Anyway, I'll try to make up for my long absence with a string of posts.
