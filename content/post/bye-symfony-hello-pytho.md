After this post you must think "this guy is nuts. Does he ever stick to what he says?" Well I can't blame you. It's simply because my company every day comes up with something new- so its the "catch me if you can" for me.

So before I even got seriously involved in symphony, I was asked to look into Database designing and  the next day that I was engrossed in DB designing("normalization" stuff- a nice topic for a future post), Vijay(the VP of neev) comes up and discusses wether I know python - well I have "heard" of python, and also about king cobras and boa constrictors- and also if I have heard of Google appengine. Anyway he was referring to the python programming language. So I turned to mighty google and trusty wiki.

So python is the brainchild of Guido van Russum the benevolent dictator for life(BDFL)- a term coined especially for him by the python community-who to this day holds a mighty sway over its past, present and future course. Some links I'd like you all to visit are:

[http://www.python.org/doc/](http://www.python.org/doc/ "python documentation") - the official python documentation site

[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benevolent_Dictator_For_Life](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benevolent_Dictator_For_Life "BDFL")- BDFL  : p

so to get started in python head to [http://www.python.org/download/](http://www.python.org/download/ "python downloads") and get the windows installer by clicking on a particular python version. If you are linux user you most probably just need to update your python, so just "yum update python" (well I use fedora so I know only fedora specific instructions). You may want to wait out a bit though- staying on the edge has its price- as i realised soon enough [GAE troubles =) ].

For windoze users- there are two(or more, I don't know) choices before you- get the official windows .msi installer or get the [http://www.activestate.com/activepython/](http://www.activestate.com/activepython/ "activestate python") apparently the second choice offers some windoze specific goodies(some COM support, etc- don't know much myself).

ok, now to the python 3.0 "issues"- python 3.x is the most recent release. Most of the junta out there still uses python 2.x. It is important to note that python 3.x is NOT backward compatible. So my "current requirement"- google appengine uses python 2.5 hence after I had enthusiastically installed 3.0 I had to install a new "old" version 2.5 python. But don't worry both python2.5 and python 3.0 reside on separate folders and hence it was no issue at all- I just executed the 2.5's .msi and that was all.

After installation I ran IDLE( the windows gui IDE of python). I must say the help of python is quite thorough so just go to help and refer to python manuals and then you should be ready to "python". So my newbie advice is use the help's manual and no need to waste time searching for good ebooks on the net( though it may not be a bad idea-just time intensive). The python documentation link is all you'll ever need if you need further resources. Head out to #python@irc.freenode.net for help. It has a "VERY"( and I mean it) large active following.

So after this once again awfullly long post I must get back to learning python-wish me luck.

Talk about DB normalization and GAE in the next few posts(probably).
