[Larry Wall](https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Larry_Wall) in his book _Programming Perl_ describes the three virtues of a Programmer thus:


1. Laziness: The quality that makes you go to great effort to reduce overall energy expenditure. It makes you write labor-saving programs that other people will find useful and document what you wrote so you don't have to answer so many questions about it.

2. Impatience: The anger you feel when the computer is being lazy. This makes you write programs that don't just react to your needs, but actually anticipate them. Or at least pretend to.

3. Hubris: The quality that makes you write (and maintain) programs that other people won't want to say bad things about.


I guess I can safely check all three.

I am a programmer by trade working to make the world a better place(cliché much?). I love working on spaghetti code(did I tell you I work for an enterprise? _gasp_..) and transforming it from an ugly duckling to a beautiful swan. 

I rarely get time for hobby projects- but I do maintain some projects over at good 'ol GitHub [@rdhushyanth](https://github.com/rdhushyanth)

For those who pay undue attention to academics(Looking at you mom ☹️ ) - I hold a BS in ECE from [IIT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_Institute_of_Technology_(BHU)_Varanasi) and an MS in CS (with specialisation in ML) from Georgia Tech(and a 4.0 GPA to boot). I guess that makes me qualified enough to ramble on a few topics without sounding like a total moron.

Things I am proud of:

- My black panther toy set
- My custom built PC(my precious!!)


Things I am not proud of:

- Not blogging enough
